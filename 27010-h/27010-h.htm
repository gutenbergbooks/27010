<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>THE STATE PRISON IN THE TOWER.</h3>

  <p>A paragraph has lately gone the round of the newspapers, in which,
  after mentioning the alterations recently made in the Beauchamp Tower and
  the opening of its "written walls" to public inspection, it is stated
  that this Tower was formerly the place of confinement for state
  prisoners, and that "Sir William Wallace and Queen Anne Boleyn" were
  amongst its inmates.</p>

  <p>Now, I believe there is no historical authority for saying that "the
  Scottish hero" was ever confined in the Tower of London; and it seems
  certain that the unfortunate queen was a prisoner in the royal
  apartments, which were in a different part of the fortress. But so many
  illustrious persons are known to have been confined in the Beauchamp
  Tower, and its walls preserve so many curious inscriptions&mdash;the
  undoubted autographs of many of its unfortunate tenants&mdash;that it
  must always possess great interest.</p>

  <p>Speaking from memory, I cannot say whether the building known as the
  Beauchamp (or Wakefield) Tower was even in existence in the time of
  Edward I.; but my impression is, that its architecture is not of so early
  a time. It is, I believe, supposed to derive its name from the
  confinement in it of Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in 1397. Of
  course it was not the only place of durance of state prisoners, but it
  was the prison of most of the victims of Tudor cruelty who were confined
  in the Tower of London; and the walls of the principal chamber which is
  on the first storey, and was, until lately, used as a mess-room for the
  officers, are covered in some parts with those curious inscriptions by
  prisoners which were first described in a paper read before the Society
  of Antiquaries in 1796, by the Rev. J. Brand, and published in the
  thirteenth volume of <i>The Archæologia</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. P. Cunningham, in his excellent <i>Handbook</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"William Wallace was lodged as a prisoner on his first arrival in
  London in the house of William de Leyre, a citizen, in the parish of All
  Hallows Staining, at the end of Fenchurch Street."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 510 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page510"></a>{510}</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Cunningham, in his notice of the Tower, mentions Wallace first
  among the eminent persons who have been confined there. The popular
  accounts of the Tower do the like. It was about the Feast of the
  Assumption (Aug. 15) that Wallace was taken and conducted to London; and
  it seems clear that he was forthwith imprisoned in the citizen's
  house:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was lodged," says Stow, "in the house of William Delect, a citizen
  of London, in Fenchurch Street. On the morrow, being the eve of St.
  Bartholomew (23rd Aug.), he was brought on horseback to Westminster ...
  the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of London accompanying him; and in the
  Great Hall at Westminster ... being impeached," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The authorities cited are, Adam Merimuth and Thomas de La More. His
  arraignment and condemnation on the Vigil of St. Bartholomew are also
  mentioned by Matthew Westminster, p. 451. Neither these historians, or
  Stow or Holinshed, afford any farther information. The latter chronicler
  says that Wallace was "condemned, and thereupon hanged" (<i>Chron.</i>,
  fol., 1586, vol. ii. p. 313.). He was executed at Smithfield; and it is
  not improbable that, if, after his condemnation, he was taken to any
  place of safe custody, he was lodged in Newgate. The following entry of
  the expenses of the sheriffs attending his execution is on the
  Chancellor's Roll of 33 Edw. I. in the British Museum:</p>

  <p>The day of the trial, August 23, is generally given the date of his
  execution. It therefore appears that the formidable Scot never was a
  prisoner in the Tower.</p>

  <p>The unfortunate Queen Anne Boleyn occupied the royal apartments while
  she was a prisoner in the Tower. From Speed's narrative, it appears that
  she continued to occupy them after she was condemned to death. On May 15
  (1536) she was (says Stow)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Arraigned in the Tower on a scaffold made for the purpose in the
  King's Hall; and after her condemnation, she was conveyed to ward again,
  the Lady Kingston, and the Lady Boloigne her aunt, attending on her."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On May 19, the unfortunate queen was led forth to "the green by the
  White Tower" and beheaded.</p>

  <p>In the record of her trial before the Duke of Norfolk, Lord High
  Steward (see <i>Report of Deputy Keeper of Public Records</i>), she is
  ordered to be taken back to "the king's prison within the Tower;" but
  these are words of form. The oral tradition cannot in this case be relied
  upon, for it pointed out the Martin Tower as the place of her
  imprisonment because, as I believe, her name was found rudely inscribed
  upon the wall. The Beauchamp Tower seems to have been named only because
  it was the ordinary state prison at the time. The narrative quoted by
  Speed shows, however, that the place of her imprisonment was the queen's
  lodging, where the fading honours of royalty still surrounded Anne
  Boleyn.</p>

<h3>INEDITED LETTER FROM HENRY VIII. OF ENGLAND
TO JAMES V. OF SCOTLAND.</h3>

  <p>I lately transcribed several very interesting original manuscripts,
  chiefly of the seventeenth century, but some of an earlier date, and now
  send you a literal specimen of one evidently belonging to the sixteenth
  century; although, notwithstanding the day of the month is given, the
  year is not. If you think it worthy of a place in your very excellent
  publication, you are quite at liberty to make use of it, and I shall be
  happy to send you some of the others, if you choose to accept them. They
  chiefly relate to the period when the Duke of Lauderdale was commissioner
  for Scotch affairs at the English Court; and one appears to be a letter
  addressed by the members of the Scottish College at Paris to James I. on
  the death of his mother.</p>

<h3>HANDBOOK TO THE LIBRARY OF THE BRITISH
MUSEUM.</h3>

  <p>In the <i>Report</i> of the royal commissioners on the British Museum,
  printed in 1850, we read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We are of opinion that, with reference to such a measure as the one
  now suggested [giving information to persons at a distance as to the
  existence of works in the library], and to other measures and regulations
  generally affecting the use of the library, it is desirable to prepare
  and publish a compendious <i>Guide to the reading-room</i>, as described
  and <i>suggested</i> by lord Seymour at Q. 9521."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The reference is erroneous. At Q. 9521. there is not a word on the
  subject! At Q. 9522. we read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"(<i>Lord Seymour</i>&mdash;to Antonio Panizzi, Esq.) You have heard
  also <i>some witnesses</i> state that it would be a great advantage to
  those who frequent the reading-room if they had put into their hands some
  short printed guide to the reading-room, to tell them what books of
  reference there were, and to tell them how they were to proceed to get
  books, and other information, from the want of which they state they have
  been at a great loss? (<i>Mr. Panizzi.</i>) I do not believe that it is
  often the case that persons are at a loss for want of such a guide, but
  <i>it might be done</i>," etc.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now, the suggestion of a <i>short printed guide to the
  reading-room</i> was evidently considered as of some importance. The
  principle of <span class="scac">SUUM CUIQUE</span> is also of some
  importance. We observe that lord Seymour the examiner ascribes the
  suggestion to <i>some witnesses</i>&mdash;but lord Seymour the reporter
  claims the credit of it for himself! It is the after-thought of his
  lordship of which I have to complain.</p>

  <p>If we turn to the evidence, it will appear that Mr. Peter Cunningham
  suggested a printed "catalogue of the books in the reading-room," Q.
  4800.&mdash;I must now speak of myself. When summoned before the
  commissioners as a witness, I took with me the printed <i>Directions
  respecting the reading-room</i> for the express purpose of pointing out
  their inconsistency and insufficiency, and of advocating the preparation
  of a guide-book.</p>

  <p>I cannot repeat my arguments. It would occupy too much space. I can
  only refer to the questions 6106-6116. The substance is this:&mdash;I
  contended that every person admitted to the reading-room should be
  furnished with instructions <i>how to proceed</i>&mdash;instructions as
  to the <i>catalogues which he should consult</i>&mdash;and instructions
  for <i>asking for the books</i>. On that evidence rests my claim to the
  credit of having suggested a <i>Guide to the reading-room</i>. Its
  validity shall be left to the decision of those who venerate the motto of
  Tom Hearne&mdash;<span class="sc">Suum cuique</span>.</p>

  <p>The trustees of the British Museum seem to have paid no attention to
  the recommendation of the royal commissioners. They issue the same
  <i>Directions</i> as before. <i>After</i> you have obtained admission to
  the reading-room, you are furnished with instructions as to the mode of
  obtaining it!&mdash;but you have no guide to the numerous catalogues.</p>

  <p>What Mr. Antonio Panizzi, the keeper of the department of printed
  books, says <i>might be done</i>, Mr. Richard Sims, of the department of
  manuscripts, says <i>shall be done</i>. His <i>Handbook to the library of
  the British Museum</i> is a very comprehensive and instructive volume. It
  is a triumphant refutation of the opinions of those who, to the vast
  injury of literature, and serious inconvenience of men of letters, slight
  common sense and real utility in favour of visionary schemes and pedantic
  elaboration.</p>

  <p>There is no want of precedents for a work of this class, either abroad
  or at home. As to the public library at Paris&mdash;I observe, in my own
  small collection, an <i>Essai historique sur la bibliothèque du roi</i>,
  par M. le Prince; a <i>Histoire du cabinet des médailles</i>, par M.
  Marion du Mersan; a <i>Notice des estampes</i>, par M. Duchesne,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>For a precedent at home, I shall refer to the <i>Synopsis of the
  contents of the British Museum</i>. The <i>first</i> edition of that
  interesting work, with the <!-- Page 512 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page512"></a>{512}</span>valued autograph of <i>G. Shaw</i>, is now
  before me. It is dated in 1808. I have also the <i>sixtieth</i> edition,
  printed in this year. I cannot expect to see a sixtieth edition of the
  <i>Handbook</i>, but it deserves to be placed by the side of the
  <i>Synopsis</i>, and I venture to predict for it a wide circulation.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Derbyshire Folk Lore.</i>&mdash;Many years ago I learned the
  following verses in Derbyshire, with reference to magpies:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"One is a sign of sorrow; two are a sign of mirth;</p>
      <p>Three are a sign of a wedding; and four a sign of a birth."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The opinion that a swarm of bees settling on a dead tree forebodes a
  death in the family also prevails in Derbyshire.</p>

  <p>In that county also there is an opinion that a dog howling before a
  house is an indication that some one is dying within the house; and I
  remember an instance where, as I heard at the time, a dog continued
  howling in a street in front of a house in which a lady was dying.</p>

  <p>It is also a prevalent notion that if the sun shines through the
  apple-trees on Christmas Day, there will be an abundant crop the
  following year.</p>

  <p>I never heard the croaking of a raven or carrion crow mentioned as an
  indication of anything, which is very remarkable, as well on account of
  its ill-omened sound, as because it was so much noticed by the
  Romans.</p>

  <p class="author">S. G. C.</p>

  <p><i>Weather Superstitions.</i>&mdash;If it rains much during the twelve
  days after Christmas Day, it will be a wet year. So say the country
  people.</p>

  <p>"If there is anything in this, 1853 will be a wet year, for it has
  rained <i>every</i> day of the twelve." So wrote I under date January
  9.</p>

  <p>No one, I think, will deny that for once the shaft has hit the
  mark.</p>

  <p><i>Folk Lore in Cambridgeshire</i> (Vol. viii., p. 382.).&mdash;The
  custom referred to by <span class="sc">Mr. Middleton</span>, of ringing
  the church bell early in the morning for the gleaners to repair to the
  fields, and again in the evening for their return home, is still kept up
  not only at Hildersham, but also in most of the villages in this
  neighbourhood. I have heard this "gleaners' bell" several times during
  this present autumn; the object of course being to give all parties a
  fair and equal chance. Upon one occasion, where the villages lie rather
  close together, I heard four of these bells sounding their recall from
  different church towers; and as I was upon an eminence from whence I
  could see the different groups wending their way to their respective
  villages, it formed one of the most striking pastoral pictures I have
  ever witnessed, such, perhaps, as England alone can furnish.</p>

<h3>RAPPING NO NOVELTY.</h3>

  <p>It may be interesting to the believers in modern miracles to learn
  that at all events "rapping" is no new thing. I now send you the account
  of an incident in the sixteenth century, which bears a strong resemblance
  to some of those veracious narrations which have enlightened mankind in
  the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>Rushton Hall, near Kettering in Northamptonshire, was long the
  residence of the ancient and distinguished family of Treshams. In the
  reign of Queen Elizabeth, the mansion was occupied by Sir Thomas Tresham,
  who was a pedant and a fanatic; but who was an important character in his
  time by reason of his great wealth and powerful connexions. There is a
  lodge at Rushton, situate about half a mile from the old hall, now in
  ruins; but covered all over, within and without, with emblems of the
  Trinity. This lodge is known to have been built by Sir Thomas Tresham;
  but his precise motive for selecting this mode of illustrating his
  favourite doctrine was unknown until it appeared from a letter written by
  himself about the year 1584, and discovered in a bundle of books and
  papers inclosed, since 1605, in a wall in the old mansion, and brought to
  light about twenty years ago. The following relation of a "rapping" or
  "knocking" is extracted from this letter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If it be demanded why I labour so much in the Trinity and Passion of
  Christ to depaint in this chamber, this is the principal instance
  thereof; That at my last being hither committed<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, and I usually having my servants
  here allowed me, to read nightly an hour to me after supper, it fortuned
  that Fulcis, my then servant, reading in the <i>Christian Resolution</i>,
  in the treatise of <i>Proof that there is a God, &amp;c.</i>, there was
  upon a wainscot table at that instant three loud knocks <!-- Page 513
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page513"></a>{513}</span>(as if it had
  been with an iron hammer) given; to the great amazing of me and my two
  servants, Fulcis and Nilkton."</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Bond a Poet, 1642, O.S.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Perfect Diurnall</i>,
  March 29, 1642, we have the following curious notice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Upon the meeting of the House of Lords, there was complaint made
  against one Bond, a poet, for making a scandalous letter in the queen's
  name, sent from the Hague to the king at York. The said Bond attended
  upon order, and was examined, and found a delinquent; upon which they
  voted him to stand in the pillory several market days in the new Palace
  (Yard), Westminster, and other places, and committed him to the
  Gatehouse, besides a long imprisonment during the pleasure of the house:
  and they farther ordered that as many of the said letter as could be
  found should be burnt."</p>

  <p>His recantation, which he afterwards made, is in the British
  Museum.</p>

  <p><i>The late Harvest.</i>&mdash;In connexion with the present late and
  disastrous harvest, permit me to contribute a distich current, as an old
  farmer observed to-day, "when I was a boy:"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p><i>Misquotation.</i>&mdash;In an article entitled "Popular Ballads of
  the English Peasantry," a correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. v., p.
  603.) quotes as "that spirit-stirring stanza of <i>immortal John</i>,"
  the lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Jesus, the name high over all," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These lines were not written by <i>John</i>, but by <i>Charles
  Wesley</i>. Here is the proof:</p>

  <p>1st. A hymn of which the stanza quoted is the first, appears (p. 40.)
  in the <i>Collection of Hymns</i> published by John Wesley in 1779; but
  in the preface he says, "but a small part of these hymns are of my own
  composing."</p>

  <p>2nd. In his <i>Plain Account of Christian Perfection</i>, he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the year 1749, my brother printed two volumes of <i>Hymns and
  Sacred Poems</i>. As I <i>did not see them</i> before they were
  published, there were some things in them which I did not approve of; but
  I quite approved of the main of the hymns on this
  head."&mdash;<i>Works</i>, vol. xi. p. 376., 12mo. ed. 1841.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>3rd. The lines quoted by your correspondent form the ninth stanza of a
  hymn of twenty-two stanzas (which includes the six in John Wesley's
  <i>Collection</i>), written "after preaching (in a church)," and
  published in "<i>Hymns and Sacred Poems</i>. In two volumes. By Charles
  Wesley, M.A., Student of Christ Church, Oxford. Bristol: printed and sold
  by Felix Farley, 1749." A copy is in my possession. The hymn is No. 194.;
  and the stanza referred to will be found in vol. i. p. 306.</p>

  note; which, if the fact be not generally known, may be of interest to
  your correspondent A.&nbsp;Z. (Vol. viii., p. 102.) as well as to others among
  the readers of "N. &amp; Q.":</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1723. Joseph, son of Samuel Reynolds, clerk, baptised July the

</blockquote>

  <p>On another page is the following memorandum:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the entry of baptisms for the year 1723, the person by mistake
  named <i>Joseph</i>, son of Samuel Reynolds, clerk, baptized July 30th,
  was <i>Joshua</i> Reynolds, the celebrated painter, who died February 23,
  1792."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Samuel Reynolds, the father, was master of Plympton Grammar School
  from about 1715 to 1745, in which year he died. During that period his
  name appears once in the parish book, in the year 1742, as "minister for
  the time being" (not incumbent of the parish): the Rev. Geo. Langworthy
  having been the incumbent from 1736 to 1745, both inclusive.</p>

  <p>Query, Was Sir Joshua by mistake <i>baptized Joseph</i>? or was the
  mistake made after baptism, in <i>registering the name</i>?</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>GRAMMAR IN RELATION TO LOGIC.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Latham (<i>Outlines of Logic</i>, p. 21., 1847, and <i>English
  Language</i>, p. 510., 2nd edition) defines the conjunction to be a part
  of speech that connects <i>propositions</i>, not <i>words</i>. His
  doctrine is so palpably and demonstrably false, that I am somewhat at a
  loss to understand how a man of his penetration can be so far deceived by
  a crotchet as to be blind to the host of examples which point to the
  direct converse of his doctrine. Let the learned Doctor try to resolve
  the sentence, <i>All men are either two-legged, one-legged, or
  no-legged</i>, into three constituent propositions. It cannot be done;
  <i>either</i> and <i>or</i> are here conjunctions which connect words and
  not propositions. In the example, <i>John and James carry a basket</i>,
  it is of course quite plain that the <i>logic</i> of the matter is that
  <i>John carries one portion of the basket, and James carries the
  rest</i>. But to identify these two propositions with the first
  mentioned, is to confound grammar with logic. The former deals with the
  method of expression, the latter with the method of stating (in thought)
  and syllogising. To take another example, <i>Charles and Thomas stole all
  the apples</i>. The fact probably was, that Charles' pockets contained
  some of the apples, and Thomas' pockets contained all the rest. But the
  business of grammar in the above sentence is to regulate the <i>form</i>
  of the expression, not to reason upon the <i>matter</i> expressed. A
  little thought will soon convince any person accustomed to these subjects
  that <i>conjunctions always connect words, not propositions</i>. The only
  work in which I leave seen Dr. Latham's fundamental error exposed, is in
  Boole's <i>Mathematical Analysis of Logic</i>; the learned author, though
  he seems unsettled on many matters of logic and metaphysics, has clearly
  made up his mind on the point now under discussion. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The proposition, every animal is <i>either</i> rational <i>or</i>
  irrational, cannot be resolved into, <i>Either</i> every animal is
  rational, <i>or</i> every animal is irrational. The former belong to pure
  categoricals, to latter to hypotheticals [Query <i>disjunctives</i>]. In
  <i>singular</i> propositions such conversions would seem to be allowable.
  This animal is <i>either</i> rational <i>or</i> irrational, is equivalent
  to, <i>Either</i> this animal is rational, <i>or</i> it is irrational.
  This peculiarity of <i>singular</i> propositions would almost justify our
  ranking them, though truly universals, in a separate class, as Ramus and
  his followers did."&mdash;P. 59.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This certainly seems unanswerable.</p>

  <p>If Dr. Latham is a reader of "N. &amp; Q.," I should be glad if he
  would give his reasons for adhering to his original doctrine in the face
  of such facts as those I have instanced.</p>

<h3>THE CORONET [CROWN] OF LLEWELYN AP GRIFFITH,
PRINCE OF WALES.</h3>

  <p>A notice, transferred to <i>The Times</i> of the 5th instant from a
  recent number of <i>The Builder</i>, on the shrine of Edward the
  Confessor, after mentioning that "to this shrine Edward I. offered the
  Scottish regalia and the coronation chair, which is still preserved,"
  adds, "Alphonso, about 1280, offered it the golden coronet of Llewelyn,
  Prince of Wales, and other jewels."</p>

  <p>Who was Alphonso? And would the contributor of the notice favour the
  readers of "N. &amp; Q." with the authority <i>in extenso</i> for the
  offering of this coronet?</p>

  <p>The period assigned for the offering is certainly too early; Llewelyn
  ap Griffith, "the last sovereign of one of the most ancient ruling
  families of Europe" (<i>Hist. of England</i>, by Sir James Mackintosh,
  vol. ii. p. 254.), having been slain at Builth, Dec. 11, 1282. Warrington
  (<i>Hist. of. Wales</i>, vol. ii. p. 271.), on the authority of Rymer's
  <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, vol. ii. p. 224., says: "Upon stripping Llewelyn
  there were found his Privy Seal; a paper that was filled with dark
  expressions, and a list of names written in a kind of cypher;" omitting,
  it will be observed, any reference to Llewelyn's coronet. That monarch's
  crown was probably obtained and transmitted to Edward I. on the capture,
  June 21, 1283, or shortly after, of his brother David ap Griffith, Lord
  of Denbigh, who had assumed the Welsh throne on the demise of Llewelyn;
  the Princess Catherine, the daughter and heir of the latter, and <i>de
  jure</i> sovereign Princess of Wales, being then an infant. Warrington
  states (vol. ii. p. 285.) that when David was taken, a relic, highly
  venerated by the Princes of Wales, was found upon him, called
  <i>Crosseneych</i>, supposed to be a part of the real cross brought by
  St. Neots into Wales from the Holy Land; and he adds that, besides the
  above relic, which was voluntarily delivered up to Edward by a secretary
  of the late Prince of Wales, "the crown of the celebrated King Arthur,
  with many precious jewels, was about this time presented to Edward,"
  citing as his authorities <i>Annales Waverleienses</i>, p. 238.; Rymer's
  <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, vol. ii. p. 247.</p>

  <p>There are some particulars of these relics in the <i>Archæologia
  Cambrensis</i>; but neither that periodical, nor the authorities referred
  to by Warrington, are at the moment accessible to me.</p>

  animal of the weasel tribe called the mousehunt, an animal apparently but
  little known; it is scarcely half the size of the common weasel, and of a
  pale mouse-colour. It is said to be well known in Suffolk, whence,
  however, after some trouble, I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a
  specimen; young stoats or weasels having been sent me instead of it. I
  could not find a specimen in the British Museum. Some years ago I saw two
  in Glamorganshire; one escaped me; the other had been killed by a ferret,
  but unfortunately I neglected to preserve it. Near the same spot last
  year a pair of them began making their nest, but being disturbed by some
  workmen employed in clearing out the drain in which they had ensconced
  themselves, were lost sight of and escaped.</p>

  <p>Mr. Colquhoun, in <i>The Moor and the Loch</i>, ed. 1851, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The English peasantry assert that there are two kinds of weasel, one
  very small, called a 'cane,' or 'the mousekiller.' This idea, I have no
  doubt, is erroneous, and the 'mousekillers' are only the young ones of
  the year, numbers of these half-grown weasels appearing in summer and
  autumn."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I know only of one species of stoat, but I have certainly seen more
  than one species of weasel.... There is one species of weasel so small
  that it can easily follow mice into their holes; and one of these, not a
  month ago, I watched go into a mouse's hole in an open grass field.
  Seeing something hopping along in the grass, which I took for a large
  long-tailed field mouse, I stood still as it was approaching my position,
  and when within a foot or two of the spot on which I was standing, so
  that I could have a full view of the animal, a very small weasel
  appeared, and quickly disappeared again in a tuft of grass. On searching
  the spot I discovered a mousehole, in which Mr. Weasel had made his
  exit."</p>

<h3>ALEXANDER CLARK.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 18.)</p>

  <p>In communicating a few particulars about Alexander Clark, I must
  disappoint your correspondent <span class="sc">Perthensis</span>;
  <i>my</i> subject answering in no respect to Peter Buchan's "drucken
  dominie," the author of the <i>Buttery College</i>. Alexander Clark, who
  has fallen in my way, belongs to the class of "amiable enthusiasts;" a
  character I am somewhat fond of, believing that in any pursuit a dash of
  the latter quality is essential to success.</p>

  <p>Clark was by profession a gardener; and as my friends in the north
  always seek to localise their worthies, I venture to assign him to
  Annandale. My first acquaintance with him arose from his <!-- Page 518
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page518"></a>{518}</span><i>Emblematical Representation</i> falling
  into my hands; and, pursuing my inquiries, I found this was but one of
  some half-dozen visionary works from the same pen. In his <i>View of the
  Glory of the Messiah's Kingdom</i>, we have the origin of his taking upon
  himself the prophetic character; it is entitled:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Brief Account of an Extraordinary Revelation, and other Things
  Remarkable, in the Course of God's Dealings with Alexander Clark,
  Gardener at Dumcrief, near Moffat, Anandale, in the Year 1749."</p>

  <p>"In the month of August, 1749," says he, "at a certain time when the
  Lord was pleased to chastise me greatly in a bed of affliction, and in
  the midst of my great trial, it pleased the Almighty God wonderfully to
  surprise me with a glorious light round about me; and looking up, I saw
  straight before me a glorious building in the air, as bright and clear as
  the sun: it was so vastly great, so amiable to behold, so full of majesty
  and glory, that it filled my heart with wonder and admiration. The place
  where this sight appeared to me was just over the city of Edinburgh; at
  the same instant I heard, as it were, the musick bells of the said city
  ring for joy."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From this period, Clark's character became tinged with that enthusiasm
  which ended in his belief that he was inspired; and that in publishing
  his&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Signs of the Times: showing by many infallible Testimonies and Proofs
  out of the Holy Scripture, that an extraordinary Change is at Hand, even
  at the very Door,"&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>he was merely "emitting what he derived directly, by special favour,
  from God!"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Spirit of God," he says on another occasion, "was so sensibly
  poured out upon me, and to such a degree, that I was thereby made to see
  things done in secret, and came to find things lost, and knew where to go
  to find those things which were lost!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This <i>second sight</i>, if I may so call it, set our author upon
  drawing aside the veil from the prophetic writings; and his view of their
  mystical sense is diffused over the indigested and rambling works bearing
  the following titles:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A View of the Glory of the Messiah's Kingdom." 1763.</p>

  <p>"Remarks upon the Accomplishment of Scripture Prophecy."</p>

  <p>"A Practical Treatise on Regeneration." 1764.</p>

  <p>"The Mystery of God opened," &amp;c. Edinburgh. 1768.</p>

  <p>"An Emblematical Representation of the Paradise of God, showing the
  Nature of Spiritual Industry in the Similitude of a Garden, well ordered,
  dressed, and kept, with Sundry Reflections on the Nature of Divine
  Knowledge, 1779."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In his <i>Address to the Friendly Society of Gardeners</i>, Clark
  gives some account of his worldly condition; of his early training in
  religious habits; his laborious and industrious devotion to his
  profession, with which he seems to have been greatly enamoured, although
  poorly paid, and often in straits. Subsequently to the great event of his
  life&mdash;his vision&mdash;our subject appears to have come south, and
  to have been in the employment of Lord Charles Spencer at Hanworth in
  Middlesex. Like most of the prophets of his day, Clark was haunted with
  the belief that the last day was approaching; and considering himself
  called upon to announce to his acquaintance and neighbours that this
  "terrible judgment of God was at hand," he got but contempt and ridicule
  for his pains:&mdash;more than that, indeed, for those raising the cry
  that he was a madman, they procured the poor man's expulsion from his
  situation. Under all these discouraging circumstances, he maintained his
  firm conviction of the approaching end of time: so strongly was his mind
  bent in this direction, that "I opened the window of the house where I
  then was," says he, "thinking to see Christ coming in the clouds!"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I was three days and three nights that I could not eat, drink, nor
  sleep; and when I would close my eyes, I felt something always touching
  me; at length I heard a voice sounding in mine ears, saying 'Sleep not,
  lest thou sleep the sleep of death:' and at that I looked for my Bible,
  and at the first opening of it I read these words, which were sent with
  power, 'To him that overcometh,'" &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Poor Clark, like his prototype Thomas Newans, laboured hard to obtain
  the sanction of the hierarchy to his predictions:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I desire no man," he says, "to believe me without proof; and if the
  Reverend the Clergy would think this worth their perusal, I would very
  willingly hear what they had to say either for or against."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The orthodoxy of the "Reverend the Clergy" was not, however, to be
  moved; and Alexander Clark and his books now but serve the end of
  pointing a moral. With more real humility and less presumption, there was
  much that was good about him; but letting his heated fancies get the
  better of the little judgment he possessed, our <i>amiable enthusiast</i>
  became rather a stumbling-block than light to his generation.</p>

<h3>AMCOTTS PEDIGREE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 387.)</p>

  <p>Although I may not be able to furnish your inquirer with full pedigree
  of this family, my Notes may prove useful in making it out.</p>

  <p>From a settlement after marriage in 1663, of Vincent Amcotts of
  Laughton, in the county of Lincoln, gentleman, I find his wife's name to
  be Amy; but who she was is not disclosed. It appears she survived her
  husband, and was his <!-- Page 519 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page519"></a>{519}</span>widow and relict and executrix living in
  1687. Their eldest daughter Elizabeth married John Sheffield, Esq., of
  Croxby, and I have noted three children of theirs, viz. Vincent, who died
  s.p.; Christopher, who, with Margaret, his wife, in 1676 sold the Croxby
  estate; and Sarah. What farther as to this branch does not appear,
  although my next Vincent Amcotts may be, and probably was, a descendant.
  This Vincent Amcotts was of Harrington, in the county of Lincoln, Esq.;
  and who, from his marriage settlement dated May 16 and 17, 1720, married
  Elizabeth, the third of the four daughters of John Quincy of Aslackby, in
  the county of Lincoln, gentleman: and I find the issue of this marriage
  to be Charles Amcotts of Kettlethorpe, in the county of Lincoln, Esq.,
  who died in 1777 s.p.; Anna Maria, whom married Wharton Emerson;
  Elizabeth, who died previous to her brother Charles; and Frances, who
  married the Rev. Edward Buckworth of Washingborough, in the county of
  Lincoln, Clerk, Doctor of Laws.</p>

  <p>After the death of Charles Amcotts, we find Wharton Emerson at
  Kettlethorpe, having assumed the name of Amcotts: he was created a
  baronet in 1796, the title being limited in remainder to the eldest son
  of his daughter Elizabeth. Sir Wharton Amcotts married a second wife,
  Amelia Campbell, by whom he had a daughter, but what became of her does
  not appear. Elizabeth, the daughter and heir of Sir Wharton Amcotts by
  his first wife Anna Maria Amcotts, married in 1780 John Ingilby, Esq., of
  Ripley, who in the next year was created a baronet: and they appear to
  have had eleven children, viz. John Charles Amcotts, the present Sir
  William Amcotts Ingelby, in whom both titles are vested, Elizabeth,
  Augusta, Anna Maria, and Ann; which last three died in infancy; Diana,
  Vincent Bosville, who died at a year old, and Julia and Constance. Thus
  far my Notes extend.</p>

<h3>SIR RALPH WINWOOD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 272.)</p>

  <p>I have an original letter of Sir Ralph Winwood's in French, addressed
  "A Monsieur Mons<sup>r</sup> Charles Huyghens, Secrétaire du Conseil
  d'estat de Mess<sup>rs</sup> les Estats à la Haye," which, as it may
  possibly be interesting to your correspondent H.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;R., I here
  transcribe:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mons<sup>r</sup>.&mdash;Vos dernières m'ont rendu tesmoignage de
  vostre bonn' affection en mon endroict. Car je m'asseure que vous
  n'eussiez jamais recommendé vostre filz à ma protection si mon nom n'eust
  esté enregistré au nombre de vos meilleurs et plus affectionnés amys. Je
  m'en vay, dans peu de jours, trouver Sa Ma<sup>té</sup> en son retour
  d'Escoce, et j'espere sur la fin du moys de 7<sup>bre</sup> de me rendre
  à ma maison à Londres. Sur ce temps-là, s'il vous plaira d'envoyer

  envoyer des nouvelles, ce seroyt d'envoyer <i>Noctuas Athenas</i>. Tout

  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p>The year is not indicated, but the allusion to the death of Concini
  (the celebrated Maréchal d'Ancre, who was assassinated by order of Louis
  XIII.) proves that this letter was written in 1617, and very shortly
  before the death of the writer, which occurred on the 27th of October in
  that year.</p>

  <p>M. Charles Huyghens, to whom the letter is addressed, was probably the
  father of Constantine Huyghens, the Dutch poet-politician, who was
  secretary and privy counsellor to the Stadtholders Frederick Henry, and
  William I. and II., and who, not improbably, was the son here mentioned
  as recommended to the protection of Sir R. Winwood, and who, at that
  date, would have been twenty-one years of age.</p>

  <p>Constantine was himself the father of the still more celebrated
  Christian Huyghens, the astronomer and mathematician. The seal on the
  letter, which is in excellent preservation, is a shield bearing the
  following arms: 1. and 4. a cross botonné, 2. and 3. three
  fleurs-de-lis.</p>

<h3>TRENCH ON PROVERBS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 387.)</p>

  <p>I hope that neither Mr. Trench nor his critic E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;B. will consider
  me interfering by my making an observation or two on the correct
  rendering of the latter part of Ps. cxxvii. 2. Mr. Trench is perfectly
  correct by supposing an ellipsis in the sentence alluded to, and the
  words</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span lang="he" class="heb" title="YITEIN LIYDIYDWO SHEINA'" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5B4;&#x5EA;&#x5BC;&#x5B5;&#x5DF; &#x5DC;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D3;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D3;&#x5D5;&#x5B9; &#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5B5;&#x5E0;&#x5B8;&#x5D0;</bdo></span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>should have been translated, "He will give to his beloved whilst he
  [the beloved] is asleep." The translation of the authorised version of
  that sacred affirmation is unintelligible. Mr. Trench has the support of
  Luther's version, which has the sentence thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Seinen Freunden giebt er es schlafend."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The celebrated German Jewish translator of the Old Testament agrees
  with Mr. Trench. The following is Dr. Zunz's rendering:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Das giebt er seinem Liebling im Schlaf."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 520 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page520"></a>{520}</span></p>

  <p>The following is the Hebrew annotation in the far-famed Moses
  Mendelsohn's edition of the Book of Psalms:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span lang="he" class="heb" title="YTNHW HQB-H LYDYDW 'SHR HW' CHPTS BW B`WDNW YSHN WBLY MRCHH:" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5EA;&#x5E0;&#x5D4;&#x5D5; &#x5D4;&#x5E7;&#x5D1;&#x5BE;&#x5D4; &#x5DC;&#x5D9;&#x5D3;&#x5D9;&#x5D3;&#x5D5; &#x5D0;&#x5E9;&#x5E8; &#x5D4;&#x5D5;&#x5D0; &#x5D7;&#x5E4;&#x5E5; &#x5D1;&#x5D5; &#x5D1;&#x5E2;&#x5D5;&#x5D3;&#x5E0;&#x5D5; &#x5D9;&#x5E9;&#x5DF; &#x5D5;&#x5D1;&#x5DC;&#x5D9; &#x5DE;&#x5E8;&#x5D7;&#x5D4;&#x5C3;</bdo></span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"The holy and blessed One will give it to his beloved, in whom He
  delights, whilst he is yet asleep and without fatigue."</p>

  <p>I need not adduce passages in the Hebrew Psalter, where such
  ellipsises do occur. E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;B. evidently knows his Hebrew Bible well, and
  a legion of examples will immediately occur to him.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Moses Margoliouth.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Wybunbury, Nantwich.</p>

  <p>If E. M. B. will refer to Hengstenberg's <i>Commentary on the
  Psalms</i>, he will find that Mr. Trench is not without authority for his
  translation of Ps. cxxvii. 2. I quote the passage from Thompson and
  Fairbairn's translation, in Clark's <i>Theological Library</i>, vol. iii.
  p. 449.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span lang="he" class="heb" title="SHN'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;</bdo></span> for <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="SHNH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5E0;&#x5D4;</bdo></span> is not the accusative, but
  the preposition is omitted, as is frequently the case with words that are
  in constant use. For example, <span lang="he" class="heb" title="BQR, `RB"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5E7;&#x5E8;,
  &#x5E2;&#x5E8;&#x5D1;</bdo></span>, to which <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="SHNH" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5E0;&#x5D4;</bdo></span> here is
  poetically made like. The exposition <i>He gives sleep</i>, instead of
  <i>in sleep</i>, gives an unsuitable meaning. For the subject is not
  about the sleep, but the gain."</p>

<h3>ON PALINDROMES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol vii., p. 178. &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>Several of your correspondents have offered Notes upon these singular
  compositions, and <span class="sc">Agricola de Monte</span> adduces</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span title="NIPSON ANOMÊMATA, MÊ MONAN OPSIN" class="grk">&Nu;&Iota;&Psi;&Omicron;&Nu; &Alpha;&Nu;&Omicron;&Mu;&Eta;&Mu;&Alpha;&Tau;&Alpha;, &Mu;&Eta; &Mu;&Omicron;&Nu;&Alpha;&Nu; &Omicron;&Psi;&Iota;&Nu;</span>"</p>

  </div>
  <p>as an example. As neither he nor <span class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe</span>
  give it as found <i>out</i> of this country, allow me to say that it was
  to be seen on a benitier in the church of Notre Dame at Paris. If it were
  not for the substitution of the adjective <span title="MONAN" class="grk"
  >&Mu;&Omicron;&Nu;&Alpha;&Nu;</span> for the adverb <span title="MONON" class="grk"
  >&Mu;&Omicron;&Nu;&Omicron;&Nu;</span>, the line would be one of the best
  specimens of the recurrent order.</p>

  <p>I notice that a correspondent (Vol. vii., p. 336.) describes the
  Palindrome as being universally <i>sotadic</i>. Now, this term was only
  intended to apply to the early samples of this fanciful species of verse
  in Latin, the production Sotades, a Roman poet, 250 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> The lines given by <span
  class="sc">B&oelig;oticus</span> (Vol. vi., p. 209.),</p>

  but pollute your pages.</p>

  <p>The hexameter "Sacrum pingue," &amp;c. given by <span
  class="grk">&Omega;</span>. <span class="grk">&Phi;</span>. (Vol. vi., p.
  36.), is to be found in Misson's <i>Voyage to Italy</i>, copied from an
  old cloister wall of Santa <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Marca'."
  >Maria</span> Novella at Florence. These ingenious verses are Leoline<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and it is noted
  that "the sacrifice of Cain was not a living victim."</p>

  <p>I have seen it stated that the English language affords but <i>one</i>
  specimen of the palindrome, while the Latin and Greek have many. The late
  Dr. Winter Hamilton, the author of <i>Nugæ Literariæ</i>, gives this
  solitary line, which at the best is awkwardly fashioned:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Lewd did I live &amp; evil did I dwel."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Is any other known?</p>

  <p>Some years since I fell in with that which, after all, is the most
  wonderful effort of the kind; at least I can conceive of nothing at all
  equal to it.</p>

  <p>It is to be found in a poem called <span title="Poiêma Karkinekon" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&omicron;&#x1F77;&eta;&mu;&alpha;
  &Kappa;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&#x1F78;&nu;</span>,
  written in ancient Greek by a modern Greek called Ambrosius, printed in
  Vienna in 1802, and dedicated to the Emperor Alexander. It contains 455
  lines, every one of which is literal palindrome.</p>

  <p>I have some hesitation in giving even a quotation; and yet,
  notwithstanding the forced character of some of the lines, your readers
  will not fail to admire the classic elegance of this remarkable
  composition.</p>

  <p><i>The Claymore</i> (Vol. viii., p. 365.).&mdash;I believe there is no
  doubt that the true Scottish claymore is the heavy two-handed sword,
  examples of which are preserved at Dumbarton Castle, and at <!-- Page 521
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page521"></a>{521}</span>Hawthornden,
  and respectively attributed to William Wallace, and to Robert the Bruce.
  The latter is a very remarkable specimen, the grip being formed either of
  the tusk of a walrus or of a small elephant, considerably curved; and the
  guard is constructed of two iron bars, terminated by trefoils, and
  intersecting each other at right angles. The blade is very ponderous, and
  shorter than usual in weapons of this description.</p>

  <p>The claymore of modern times is a broadsword, double or single-edged,
  and provided with a basket hilt of form peculiar to Scotland, though the
  idea was probably derived from Spain. Swords with basket hilts were
  commonly used by the English cavalry in the reigns of Charles I. and II.,
  but they are always of a different type from the Scotch, though affording
  as complete a protection to the hand. I possess some half-dozen examples,
  some from Gloucestershire, which are of the times of the civil wars.
  There are many swords said to have been the property of Oliver Cromwell;
  one is in the United Service Museum: all that I have seen are of this
  form.</p>

  <p><i>Lewis and Sewell Families</i> (Vol. viii., p. 388.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent may obtain, in respect to the Lewis family, much
  information in the <i>Life and Correspondence of Matthew Gregory
  Lewis</i>, two vols. 8vo., London, 1839, particularly at pp. 6. and 7. of
  vol. i. He will there find that Matthew Lewis, Esq., who was Deputy
  Secretary of War for twenty-six years, married Frances Sewell, youngest
  daughter of the Right Hon. Sir Thos. Sewell; that Lieut.-Gen. Whitelocke
  and Gen. Sir Thos. Brownrigg, G.C.B., married the other two daughters of
  Sir Thos. Sewell; and that Matthew Gregory Lewis, who wrote the <i>Castle
  Spectre</i>, &amp;c., was son of Matthew Lewis, Esq., the Deputy
  Secretary of War.</p>

  <p>With regard to the Sewell family. The Right Hon. Sir Thos. Sewell, who
  was Master of the Rolls for twenty years, died in 1784; and there is, I
  believe, a very correct account of his family connexions in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1784, p. 555. He died intestate, and his
  eldest son, Thos. Bailey Heath Sewell, succeeded to his estate of
  Ottershaw and the manors of Stannards and Fords in Chobham, Surrey. This
  gentleman was a magistrate for the county of Surrey; and in the spring of
  1794, when this country was threatened by both foreign and domestic
  enemies, he became Lieut.-Col. of a regiment of Light Dragoons
  (fencibles), raised in Surrey (at Richmond) by George Lord Onslow,
  Lord-Lieut. of the county, in which he served six years, till the
  Government not requiring their services they were disbanded. Lieut.-Col.
  Sewell died in 1803, and was buried in the church at Chobham, where there
  is a monument to his memory. Of his family we have not farther knowledge
  than that he had a son, Thos. Bermingham Heath Sewell, who was a cornet
  in the 32nd Light Dragoons, and lieutenant in the 4th Dragoon Guards
  during the war of the French Revolution. The <i>History and Antiquities
  of Surrey</i>, by the Rev. Owen Manning and Wm. Bray, in three vols.
  folio, 1804, has in the third volume much concerning the Sewell
  family.</p>

  <p><i>Pharaoh's Ring</i> (Vol. viii., p. 416.).&mdash;The mention of the
  ring conferred on, or confided to, Joseph by the Pharaoh of Egypt, as
  stated in Genesis xli. 42., reminds me of a ring being shown to me some
  years ago, which was believed by its then possessor to be the identical
  ring, or at all events a signet ring of the very Pharaoh who promoted
  Joseph to the chief office in his kingdom.</p>

  <p>It was a ring of pure gold, running through a hole in a massive wedge
  of gold, about the size, as far as I recollect, of a moderate-sized
  walnut. On one of its faces was cut the hieroglyphic (inclosed as usual
  with the names of Egyptian kings in an oval), as I was assured, of the
  king, the friend of Joseph, as was generally supposed by the readers of
  hieroglyphics: I pretend to no knowledge of them myself.</p>

  <p>The possessor of the ring, who showed it to me, was Mr. Sams, one of
  the Society of Friends, a bookseller at Darlington. Since railroads have
  <!-- Page 522 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page522"></a>{522}</span>whirled me past that town, I have lost my
  means of periodical communication with him. He had, not long before I saw
  him last, returned from the Holy Land, where he assured me he had visited
  every spot that could be identified mentioned in the New Testament. He
  had also been some time in Egypt, and had brought home a great quantity
  of Egyptian antiquities. The lesser ones he had in the first floor of a
  carver and gilder's in Great Queen Street, between the Freemason's Tavern
  and Lincoln's Inn Fields. He was then anxious that these should be bought
  for the British Museum, and I think that at his request I wrote to the
  Earl of Aberdeen to mention this, and that the answer was that there was
  already so large a collection in the Museum, that more, as they must most
  of them be duplicates, would be of no use.</p>

  <p>What has become of them I know not. I was told that a number of his
  larger antiquities, stone and marble, were for some time placed on
  Waterloo Bridge, that being a very quiet place, where people might view
  them without interruption. I did not happen to be in London that season,
  and therefore did not see them.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Ss.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The whole of Mr. Sams's collection of Egyptian antiquities were
  bought by Joseph Mayer, Esq, F.S.A., of Liverpool, about two years ago,
  to add to his previous assemblage of similar monuments, and are placed by
  him, with a very valuable collection of mediæval antiquities, in the
  Egyptian Museum, 8. Colquitt Street, Liverpool. The small charge of
  sixpence for each visit opens the entire collection to the public; but it
  is a lamentable fact, that the curiosity or patriotism of the inhabitants
  does not cover Mr. Mayer's expenses by a large annual amount.]</p>

  <p><i>Red Hair</i> (Vol. vii., p. 616.; Vol. viii., p. 86.).&mdash;It is
  frequently stated that the Turks are admirers of red hair. I have lately

  red-haired persons who are fat as "first-rate" people, but those who are
  lean as the very reverse.</p>

  <p><i>"Land of Green Ginger"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 227.).&mdash;The
  authority which I am able to afford <span class="sc">Mr.
  Richardson</span> is simply the tradition of the place, which I had so
  frequently heard that I could scarcely doubt the truth of it; this I
  intended to be deduced, when I said I did not recollect that the local
  histories gave any derivation, and that it was the one "generally
  received by the inhabitants."</p>

  <p>To any mind the solution brought forward by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Buckton</span> (Vol. viii., p. 303.) carries the greatest amount of
  probability with it of any yet proposed; and should any of your
  correspondents have the opportunity of looking through the unpublished
  history of Hull by the Rev. De la Pryme, "collected out of all the
  records, charters, deeds, mayors' letters, &amp;c. of the said town," and
  now placed amongst the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum, I am
  inclined to think it is very likely it would be substantiated.</p>

  <p>In Mr. Frost's valuable work on the town, which by the way proves it
  to have been "a place of opulence and note at a period long anterior to
  the date assigned to its existence by historians," he differs materially
  from <span class="sc">Mr. Richardson</span>, in considering that Hollar's
  plate was "engraved about the year 1630," not in 1640 as he states. There
  is also another which appeared between the time of Hollar and Gent, in
  Meisner's <i>Libellus novus politicus emblematicus Civitatum</i>,
  published in 1638, which though not "remarkable for accuracy of design,"
  is well worthy of notice. It bears the title "Hull in Engellandt," and
  also the following curious inscriptions, which I copy for the interest of
  your readers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>"I put a spoke in his wheel"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 351.).&mdash;Does
  not this phrase mean simply interference, either for good or evil? I
  fancy the metaphor is really derived from putting the bars, or spokes,
  into a capstan or some such machine. A number <!-- Page 523 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page523"></a>{523}</span>of persons being
  employed, another puts his spoke in, and assists or hinders them as he
  pleases. Can a <i>stick</i> be considered a <i>spoke</i> before it is put
  into its place, in the nave of the wheel at least? We often hear the
  observation, "Then I put in my spoke," &amp;c. in the relation of an
  animated discussion. May I venture to suggest a pun on the preterite of
  the verb <i>to speak</i>?</p>

  <p>As the shepherd in Virgil had found Love to be not the gentle being he
  expected, but of a savage race&mdash;"a native of the rocks"&mdash;so had
  Johnson found a patron to be "one who looked with unconcern on a man
  struggling for life," instead of a friend to render assistance.</p>

  <p>Supposing Johnson's estimate of Lord Chesterfield's conduct to be
  correct, I cannot help thinking the allusion to be eminently happy.</p>

  <p><i>Ireland a bastinadoed Elephant</i> (Vol. viii., p. 366.).&mdash;I

  a bull, as <a href="images/oldew.png"><img src="images/oldew.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="Old English W" /></a>. inclines
  to call it. If any one will look at a physical map of Ireland at some
  little distance, a very slight exercise of the "mind's eye" will serve to
  call up in the figure of that island the shape of a creature kneeling and
  in pain. Lough Foyle forms the eye; the coast from Bengore Head to
  Benmore Head the nose or snout; Belfast Lough the mouth; the coast below
  Donaghdee the chin; County Wexford the knees. The rest of the outline,
  according to the imagination of the observer, may assume that of an
  elephant, or something, perhaps, "very like a whale." Some fanciful
  observation of this kind may have suggested the otherwise unaccountable
  simile to Curran.</p>

  <p><i>Ennui</i> (Vol. vii., p. 478.; Vol. viii., p. 377.).&mdash;The

  <i>nuit</i>. It is somewhat equivalent to the Greek <span
  title="agrupnia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&gamma;&rho;&upsilon;&pi;&nu;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>, and
  signifies the sense of weariness with doing nothing. It gives the lie to
  the <i>dolce far niente</i>: vide Ps. cxxx. 6., and Job vii. 3, 4.
  <i>Ennui</i> is closely allied to our <i>annoy</i> or <i>annoyance</i>,
  through <i>noceo</i>, <i>noxa</i>, and their probable root <i>nox</i>,
  <span title="nux." class="grk">&nu;&#x1F7A;&xi;.</span> It is precisely
  equivalent to the Latin <i>tædium</i>, which may be derived from
  <i>tæda</i>, which in the plural means a torch, and through that word may
  have a side reference to night, the <i>tædarum horæ</i>: cf. Ps. xci. 5.
  The subject is worthy of strict inquiry on the part of comparative
  philologists.</p>

  <p><i>Encore</i> (Vol. viii., p. 387.).&mdash;If A.&nbsp;A. knows the meaning
  of "this French word" I am a little surprised at his Query. Perhaps he
  means to ask why a French word should be used? It probably was first used
  at concerts and operas (<i>ancora</i> in Italian), where the performers
  and even the performances were foreign, and so became the fashion. Pope
  says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To the same notes thy sons shall hum or snore,</p>
      <p>And all thy yawning daughters cry <i>encore</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It was not, I think, in use so early as Shakspeare's time, who makes
  Bottom anticipate that "the Duke shall say, Let him roar <i>again</i>,
  let him roar <i>again</i>," where the jingle of "encore" would have been
  obvious. It is somewhat curious that where we use the French word
  <i>encore</i>, the French audiences use the Latin word "bis."</p>

  <p><i>"Hauling over the Coals"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 125.).&mdash;This
  saying I conceive to have arisen from the custom prevalent in olden
  times, when every Baron was supreme in his own castle, of extracting
  money from the unfortunate Jews who happened to fall into his power, by
  means of torture. The most usual <i>modus operandi</i> seems to have been
  roasting the victims over a slow fire. Every one remembers the treatment
  of Isaac of York by Front-de-B&oelig;uf, so vividly described in Sir
  Walter Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i>. Although the practice has long been
  numbered amongst the things that were, the fact of its having once
  obtained is handed down to posterity in this saying, as when any one is
  taken to task for his shortcomings he is <i>hauled over the
  coals</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The Words "Cash" and "Mob"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 386.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Mr. Fox</span> was right: <i>mob</i> is not genuine
  English&mdash;teste Dean Swift! A lady who was well known to Swift used
  to say that the greatest scrape she ever got into with him was by using
  the word <i>mob</i>. "Why do you say that?" he exclaimed in a passion;
  "never let me hear you say that again!" "Why, sir," she asked, "what am I
  to say?" "The rabble, to be sure," answered he. (Sir W. Scott's <i>Works
  of Swift</i>, vol. ix.) The word appears to have been introduced about
  the commencement of the eighteenth century, by a process to which we owe
  many other and similar barbarisms&mdash;"beauties introduced to supply
  the want of wit, sense, humour, and learning." In a paper of <i>The
  Tatler</i>, No. 230., much in the spirit, and possibly from the pen, of
  Swift, complaint is made of the "abbreviations and elisions" which had
  recently been introduced, and a humorous example of them is given. By
  these, the author adds,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Consonants of most obdurate sound are joined together without one
  softening vowel to intervene; and all this only to make one syllable of
  two, directly contrary to the example of the Greeks and Romans, and a
  natural tendency towards relapsing into barbarity. And this is still more
  visible in the next refinement, which consists in pronouncing the first
  syllable in a word that has many, and dismissing the rest. Thus we cram
  one syllable and cut off the rest, as the owl fattened her mice after she
  had bit off their legs to prevent their running away; and if ours be the
  same reason for maiming our words, it will certainly answer the end, for
  I am sure no other nation will desire to borrow them."</p>

  ninety years ago, where my informant, now many years deceased, was
  educated. As <i>se</i> was not there pronounced like <i>cee</i>, but like
  <i>say</i>, there was no danger of confounding the two names. In England,
  where a different pronunciation of the Latin word prevailed, such
  confusion would be apt to occur; and hence, probably, English teachers
  substituted <i>and</i> for <i>et</i>; from which, in course of time, the
  other corruptions mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> were
  developed.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"William Keate of Hagbourne, in Berkshire, left five sons. The second
  son, Ralph Keate of Whaddon, in Wiltshire, married Anne, daughter of John
  Clarke, Esq., of Ardington, in Berkshire, and had with other issue
  Gilbert Keate, Esq., of London, who married, first, John, daughter of
  Niclolas Turbervile, Esq. of Crediton, in Devon, and, secondly,
  Elizabeth, daughter of William Armstrong, Esq., of Remston, Notts, and by
  her had another son, Jonathan Keate, Esq., of the Hoo, in the county of
  Hertford, which estate he acquired with his first wife, Susannah daughter
  of William, and sister and heir of Thomas Hoo, of the Hoo and Kimpton,
  both in Hertfordshire. Mr. Keate was created a baronet by King Charles
  II., 12th June, 1660. Sir Jonathan was sheriff of the county of Hertford,
  17 Charles II., and knight of the same shire in Parliament, in the
  thirtieth of the same reign. By his first wife he had issue, Gilbert Hoo,

  <p>An iron hour-glass stand still remains near the pulpit in the church
  of Ashby-Folville, in this county (Leicester). It is fixed to the wall
  containing the staircase to the rood-loft.</p>

  <p>In the old church of Anstey, recently pulled down and rebuilt, was an
  ancient hour-glass stand, consisting of a pillar of oak, about four feet
  high, the top of which is surmounted by a light framework of wood for the
  reception of the hour-glass. This specimen is preserved in the museum of
  this town.</p>

  <p><i>Marriage of Cousins</i> (Vol. viii., p. 387.).&mdash;If there is
  any foundation for such a statement as is contained in the Query of J.&nbsp;P.
  relative to the marriage of cousins, it consists rather in the marriage
  of first cousins once removed than of second cousins. It will be seen
  that the latter relationship belongs to the same generation, but it is
  not so with the former, which partakes more of the nature of uncle and
  aunt with nephew and niece.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. Sloane Sloane-Evans.</span></p>

  <p>Cornworthy Vicarage, Totnes.</p>

  <p>There is no legal foundation for the statement that marriage with a
  second cousin is valid, and with a first cousin invalid. The following
  quotation from Burn's <i>Ecc. Law</i> by Phill., vol. ii. p. 449., will
  probably be considered to explain the matter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"By the civil law first cousins are allowed to marry, but by the canon
  law both first and second cousins (in order to make dispensations more
  frequent and necessary) are prohibited; therefore, when it is vulgarly
  said that first cousins may marry, but second cousins cannot, probably
  this arose by confounding these two laws, for first cousins may marry by
  the civil law, and second cousins cannot by the canon law."</p>

  <p><i>"When the Maggot bites"</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 244. 304.
  353.).&mdash;Another illustration of this phrase may be found in Swift
  (Introduction to <i>Tale of a Tub</i>):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The two principal qualifications (says he) of a fanatic preacher are,
  his inward light, and his head full of <i>maggots</i>; and the two
  different fates of his writings are to be burnt or worm-eaten."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The word <i>maggot</i> is sometimes used for the whim or crotchet
  itself; thus Butler:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To reconcile our late dissenters,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So also it is used by Samuel Wesley (father of the founder of the
  Methodists) in his rare and facetious volume entitled <i>Maggots, or
  Poems on several Subjects never before handled</i>, 12mo., 1685.</p>

  <p><i>"Salus populi," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. viii., p. 410.).&mdash;The saying
  "Salus populi supreme lex" is borrowed from the model law of Cicero, in
  his treatise <i>de Legibus</i>, <span class="scac">III</span>. 3. It is
  made one of the duties of the consuls, the supreme magistrates, to regard
  the safety of the state as their highest rule of conduct:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Regio imperio duo sunto; iique præeundo, judicando, consulendo
  Prætores, Judices, Consules appellantor. Militiæ summum jus habento,
  nemini parento: <i>ollis salus populi suprema lex esto</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The allusion appears to be to the formula used by the senate for
  conferring supreme power on the consuls in cases of emergency: "Dare
  operam, ne quid respublica detrimenti caperet." (See Sallust, <i>Bell.
  Cat.</i> c. 29.)</p>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

  <p>Aristotle regards the safety of the citizens as the great end of law
  (see his <i>Ethics</i>, b. <span class="scac">I</span>. ch. 4.); and
  Cicero (<i>de Finibus</i>, lib. ii. c. 5.) lays down a similar
  principle.</p>

  <p><i>Theodoro Paleologus</i> (Vol. viii., p. 408.).&mdash;The

  and with some account of the Paleologi to which a Querist was referred in
  "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. v., p. 280. (see also pp. 173. 357.). It is
  astonishing how much will be found in that "Californian mine," if the

  <p><i>Buckle</i> (Vol. viii., p. 304.).&mdash;This word is in common use
  by the artizans who work upon sheet-iron, to denote the curl which a
  sheet of iron acquires in passing through a pair of rollers. The word has
  been derived from the French <i>boucle</i>, a curl. The shoe-buckle has
  got its name from its curved form. In the days in which every man in this
  country, who was in easy circumstances, wore a wig, it was well known
  that to put a wig in <i>buckle</i>, meant to arrange its curls in due
  form.</p>

  <p><i>The "Forlorn Hope"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 411.).&mdash;This is no

  captain, who, being often a disappointed man, or one indifferent to
  consequences, now ran the "forlorn hope" either of ending his days or
  obtaining a tomb in Westminster Abbey. From the captain, after a time,
  the term descended to all the little gallant band. In no part of our
  community will you find such <!-- Page 527 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page527"></a>{527}</span>meaning expressions (often very slang
  ones) used as in the army. A lady, without hearing anything to shock
  "ears polite," might listen to the talk of a mess table, and be unable to
  understand clearly in what the conversation consisted. "He is gone to the
  bad"&mdash;meaning, he is ruined. "A wigging from the office" (a very
  favourite expression)&mdash;a reprimand from the colonel. "Wigging"
  naturally arising from tearing the hair in anger or sorrow, and the
  office of course substituting the place from whence it comes for the

  <p><i>Sangaree</i> (Vol. iii., p. 141.).&mdash;I take it that the word
  ought to be spelled <i>sansgris</i>, being derived from the French words
  <i>sans</i>, without, and <i>gris</i>, tipsy, meaning a beverage that
  would not make tipsy. I have been a good deal in the French island of
  Martinique, and they use the term frequently in this sense as applied to
  a beverage made of white wine ("Vin de Grave"), syrup, water, and nutmeg
  with a small piece of fresh lime-skin hanging over the edge of the glass.
  A native of Martinique gave me this as the derivation of the word. The
  beverage ought not to be stirred after the nutmeg is put in it, as the
  fastidious say it would spoil the flavour.</p>

  <p><i>Point of Etiquette</i> (Vol. viii., p. 386.).&mdash;The title
  <i>Miss</i>, without the Christian name, belongs to the eldest unmarried

  own children, his brother is <i>heir presumptive</i> merely to the family
  honours; and can neither assume nor give to his daughter the titles to
  which they are only expectants. The matter becomes evident, if you test
  the rule by a peerage instead of a squirage. Even the eldest daughter of
  a baronet or landed gentleman loses her title of Miss, when her brother
  succeeds to the representation, provided he have a daughter to claim the
  title.</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of "Monk" and "Till," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 291.

  is manifestly a Greek formative from <span title="monos" class="grk"
  >&mu;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, and denotes a
  <i>solitaire</i>.</p>

  <p>The proposed derivation of <i>till</i>, from <i>to-while</i>, is not
  new; but still clearly mistaken, inasmuch as the word <i>till</i> is
  found in Scotch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and others of the family. A
  word thus compounded would be of less general use. Besides which,
  <i>to-while</i> would scarcely produce such a form as <i>till</i>; it
  would rather change the <i>t</i> into an aspirate, which would appear as
  <i>th</i>.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Lardner has just published the third and concluding course of his
  <i>Handbook of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy</i>. The subjects treated
  of in the present volume are <i>Meteorology and Astronomy</i>, and they
  are illustrated with thirty-seven lithographic plates, and upwards of two
  hundred engravings on wood. The work was undertaken with the very popular
  object of supplying the means of acquiring a competent knowledge of the
  methods and results of the physical sciences, without any unusual
  acquaintance with mathematics; and in the methods of demonstration and
  illustration of this series of treatises, that principle has as far as
  possible, been adopted so that by means of the present volumes, persons
  who have not even a superficial knowledge of geometry and algebra may yet
  acquire with great facility a considerable acquaintance with the sciences
  of which they treat. The present volume contains a very elaborate index,
  which, <!-- Page 528 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page528"></a>{528}</span>combined with the analytical tables of
  contents, give to the entire series all the usefulness of a compendious
  encyclopædia of natural philosophy and astronomy.</p>

  <p><i>Willich's Income Tax Tables, Fourth Edition, 1853-1860</i>, price
  <i>One Florin</i>, show at one view the amount of duty at the various
  rates fixed by the late act, and are accompanied by a variety of
  statistical information, tending to show that the wealth of the nation
  has increased in as great, if not a greater, ratio, than the population.
  The price at which the work is issued serves to lead our attention to a
  little pamphlet, published at sixpence, or 25 <i>mils</i>, by Mr. Robert
  Mears, entitled <i>Decimal Coinage Tables for simplifying and
  facilitating the Introduction of the proposed new Coinage</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy by Ordericus
  Vitalis, translated with Notes, and the Introduction of Guizot</i>, by
  Thomas Forrester, M.A. Vol. I., is a new volume of the interesting Series
  of Translations of the early <i>Church Historians of England</i>
  publishing by Mr. Bohn, to which we propose calling the especial
  attention of our readers at some future period. The importance which our
  French neighbours attach to the writings of Ordericus Vitalis is shown by
  the fact that the French Historical Society, after publishing a
  translation, are now issuing an edition of the original text, from a
  laborious collation of the best MSS., under the editorship of M. Auguste
  le Prevost. The present translation is based upon that edition.</p>

  <p>We have on several occasions called the attention of our readers to
  the Collection of Proclamations in the possession of the Society of
  Antiquaries, and to the endeavours making by that learned body to secure
  as complete a series as possible of these valuable but hitherto little
  used materials for English History. Some contributions towards this
  object have, we believe, been the results of our notices; and we have now
  to state, that at the opening meeting on Thursday the 17th, it was
  announced that William Salt, Esq., F.S.A., had presented to the library
  two volumes of Proclamations of the reigns of Elizabeth and James I.
  Great as is the pecuniary value of this munificent donation, it is far
  exceeded by its importance in filling up a large gap in the existing
  Series. A <i>Catalogue Raisonnée</i> of the whole collection is in
  preparation by Robert Lemon, Esq., of the State Paper Office, a gentleman
  well qualified for the task, and its early publication may, we trust, be
  received as an evidence of the beneficial influence which the Society of
  Antiquaries is hereafter destined to exercise on the historical
  literature of England.</p>

  <p>BOHN'S BRITISH CLASSICS.&mdash;Under the above Title is this Day
  commenced a New Series (which has long been in preparation), uniform in
  Size and Price with the Standard Library. It will comprise full and
  complete Editions of the great Authors of our Literature, including
  especially those which at present exist only in scarce or expensive
  Editions. Among the early Volumes will be GIBBON'S DECLINE AND FALL OF
  THE ROMAN EMPIRE, with VARIORUM NOTES, comprising not only all those
  given in the Original Quarto Edition, but also the Notes of Guizot,
  Wenck, and other Foreign Editors, as well as whatever has been derived
  from the later Researches of Niebuhr, Layard, &amp;c. A Portrait of the
  Author and Plates, whenever essential as Illustrations, will be added, on
  the same plan as the recent Edition of SOUTHEY'S COWPER published in the
  STANDARD LIBRARY.</p>

  <p>Although it is deemed expedient to enter on a New Series under the
  Title of BRITISH CLASSICS, to enable the Publisher, without farther
  delay, to fructify a long cherished scheme, the Standard, Scientific,
  Antiquarian, Illustrated, Classical, Philological, and Ecclesiastical
  Libraries will be continued with undiminished attention.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the

  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

  <p>On Thursday, the 5th of January, 1854, will be published, price
  Twopence, the First of a Series of Works, entitled ORR'S CIRCLE OF THE
  SCIENCES; consisting of Short Treatises on the Fundamental Principles and
  Characteristic Features of Scientific and Practical Pursuits. With
  Numerous Illustrative Engravings on Wood.</p>

  <p>MESSRS. W. S. ORR &amp; CO. have to announce the Early Publication, in
  Weekly Numbers, of a Series of Short Treatises, which will include every
  useful and attractive section of human acquirement, whether scientific,
  practical, or descriptive; and which will be issued at a price so
  moderate as to place them within the reach of every member of the
  community.</p>

  <p>Although every subject will be treated in a philosophic spirit, yet it
  will not be forgotten that the work is designed for popular use; and
  therefore the Editor and the various Contributors will endeavour to
  clothe the whole Series, and the Scientific Treatises especially, in
  simple language, so as to render them easy introductions to practical
  studies.</p>

  <p>To carry the design into effect, assistance has been obtained from
  eminent scientific men: and the Editor has the satisfaction of announcing
  among the Contributors to the first year's volumes the names of Professor
  Owen, of the Royal College of Surgeons; Sir William Jardine, Bart.;
  Professors Ansted and Tennant, of King's College; the Rev. Walter
  Mitchell, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; and Professor Young, Examiner in
  Mathematics at the University of London. Every confidence, therefore, may
  be placed in the publication, as regards its soundness of principle, its
  extent of information, and its accordance with the results of the latest
  researches and discoveries.</p>

  <p>During the first year either three or four volumes will be completed.
  The respective subjects will not be issued in consecutive weeks; but the
  paging of each series will be continuous:&mdash;so that the whole, when
  collected at the end of the year, will form separate Volumes, with
  Title-pages, Prefaces, Tables of Contents, Indices&mdash;each Volume
  being a distinct work on Natural Philosophy, on the Two Great Divisions
  of Natural History, and on the Mathematical Sciences.</p>

  <p>The "Circle of the Sciences" will thus, by the aid of copious
  Analytical Indices, combine all the advantages of an Encyclopædia, as a
  work of reference, without the irksome repetition which alphabetical
  arrangements necessarily involve.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>On the 1st of December an Introductory Treatise,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the NATURE, CONNECTION, and USES of the GREAT DEPARTMENTS of HUMAN
  KNOWLEDGE."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Will be issued; but the Publication of the Work itself will not
  commence until January, 1854.</p>

  <p>"Orr's Circle of Sciences" can be supplied by every Bookseller in the
  Kingdom; of whom a detailed Prospectus, containing Specimen Page and List
